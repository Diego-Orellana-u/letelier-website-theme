# Letelier E-commerce Proyect

I developed Letelier's E-commerce website, a leading company specializing in art, antiques, and collectibles in Chile. The website was crafted using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Liquid. Notably, no theme builder or template was utilized in its creation.

## Description

Letelier team contacted me on october regarding their intentions to develop an E-commerce website. I conducted an analysis of companies in the sector, creating a list with the main good and bad practices observed in their websites. Additionally, I examined the primary design elements employed by similar websites specializing in antiques and art sales.

During my assessment, I identified 3 key factors that would set Letelier's website apart from others:
    1° A focus on excellent UX/UI, particularly emphasizing web performance and an easily navigable interface.
    2° Implementation of an elegant and minimalist design that aligns with the company's branding.
    3° Good SEO practices.

I told Letelier team that creating a completely custom E-commerce platform from scratch would be excessive for a small business, leading to a significant increase in development and maintenance costs of the backend. Also, I highlighted the necessity of a dedicated team to effectively manage payment gateways and sensitive data to avoid potential legal issues.

We determined that the best approach was the development of a completely custom Frontend made with code, ensuring an optimized user experience, but letting Shopify manage the Backend of the store, enhancing security measures and simplifying maintenance. I deliberately dismissed the use of Shopify Themes due to their potential impact on performance and customization limitations.

The proyect proved to be a success, resulting in a fully operational E-commerce website, with great performance, consistently scoring above 95 on mobile devices according to Lighthouse metrics. Also is aesthetically pleasing, easy to customize and have the current best practices in terms of SEO.

## Getting Started

### Languages

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Liquid

### Main approach and problem-solving

I structured the development into four phases:
    1° Building MVP
    2° Optimizing web performance
    3° Optimizing UX/UI
    4° Launch

1° Building MVP: (2 weeks)

    I dedicated the first week to establishing the primary layout and design elements of the website. Simultaneously, I familiarized myself with Liquid/Shopify because they were new technologies for me.

    My visual approach focused on a minimalist and elegant design, employing simple colors such as black, white and cream while prioritizing a straightforward user experience.

    The MVP was succesfully achieved in 2 weeks. The main difficulties along the way was the implementation of elements like filters and search pages, mainly because the connection with the backend provided by Shopify wasn't easy due to limited documentation. However, these difficulties were solved succesfully within a few days.
